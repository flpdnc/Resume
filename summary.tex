I am an accomplished Production Engineer with 10+ years of experience in Linux Systems Engineering, CI/CD Framework development, Python, and Server configuration and provisioning. I take on projects to improve existing pipelines and applications, as well as architect and implement solutions from scratch. I am adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure performance, scalability, and reliability of build and test pipelines, applications, and infrastructure.
