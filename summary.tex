\color{solarized-cyan}As an experienced Production Engineer with 10+ years of expertise in Linux Systems Engineering, CI/CD Framework development, and Server configuration and provisioning, I excel at improving existing pipelines and applications, as well as architecting and implementing solutions from scratch. My skills in collaborating with cross-functional teams have been invaluable in ensuring the performance, scalability, and reliability of build and test pipelines, applications, and infrastructure. Additionally, I have a track record of success in developing deployment pipelines ranging from bare-metal server provisioning to virtual machine and container based systems integration testing.
